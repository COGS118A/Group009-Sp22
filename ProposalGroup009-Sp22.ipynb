        "Heart related issues are critical to our lives and it is crucial to detect them early on. Our goal in this project is to successfully classify if a person does or does not have a heart disease. The data represents a person's health related information such as cholesterol level and heart rate, and also other health related activities such as smoking. We will be cleaning the data by converting any categorical values into numerical representation using different encoding methods and removing any unnecessary features. After cleaning the data, we will perform an exploratory data analysis to learn more about the pattern of the dataset and do feature extraction/selection accordingly. Different classification algorithms will then be used to find out which one provide the best results that can solve our proposed problem. Within each algorithm, we will first find the best setting that maximizes their own performance, and then each of their performance will be benchmarked against that of another algorithm to find the best solution."

        "\n",
        "Heart disease also known as cardiovascular disease, is one of the main reason for the deaths of many indivduals around the world. Most noteably about 82% of deaths in low to middle income countries split relatively even between male and females<a name=\"hajar\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#hist). Studies looking into the causes of heart disease has been excercised ever since the death of US President Franklin D. Roosevelt who was a victim to this, the lack of preparation to counter this disease proved our lack of knowledge towards it. Research into the causes of heart disease has been done within the town of Framingham where they found that vicitims commonly had a combination of high blood pressure, smoking, obesity and high blood cholesterol. It's emphasized that there is no sole reason for the cause of heart disease in addition to the above universally applying to other racial and ethnic groups. The Framingham organization in addition to Journal of the American Heart Association has also did a study on cardiovascular disease\n",
        "where they found that hypertension is one of the primary risk factors which increase probability of stroke, coronary heart disease and heart failure<a name=\"vaugham\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#hypertensions). The presence of hypertension was in 47.3% of adults in the US between 2015-2018 where ~80% of those individuals had uncontrolled hypertension and this in great risk of heart disease. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another study heart disease identification using machine learning algorithms is another example of previous research into this topic where they used ensemble of deep neural networks as a model to classify whether a patient is prone to have heart disease<a name=\"Tuli\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#diseaseAlg). In this study they took the data from heart patients in the Cleaveland dataset and coresponded known output class in addition to trained model to predict results in real time. Training, validation and testing was split 70:10:20 where they used Nodes to represent their neural networks. This effective algorithm was validated for real-life heart patients were this experience yielded useful data for future investigations on this matter. Knowing this, looking into the causes of this disease is essential for the benefit of hummanity as it can save many lives, with integrating machine learning algorithms to identify heart disease in early stages can potentially prevent the death of others."

        "Our work aim to use machine learning methods will predict whether or not a patient would potentially having heart disease base on their basic demographic information and medical history record. The early prognosis of heart diseases can help in making decisions on lifestyle changes in high risk patients and reduce the complications. \n",

        "Our task is categorized as a classification task. This is supervised learning techinique where class attribute is involved in the construction of the classifier and is used to classify or predict the data unknown sample. Generally, for every patient, our model's prediction would be 1 if the patient would potentially have heart disease in 10 years and 0 otherwise. To generate such prediction,  we will be using different classification models in machine learning such as Losgistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neigbor and Neural Networks. We will use several evaluation metrics including Accuracy, $F_1$ score and AUC-ROC curve to measure our model's prediction and performance. "

The logistic function (or sigmoid): $$\\sigma(k) = \\frac{1}{1+e^{-k}}$$ turns a predicted value into a probability value that indicates how likely it is for that prediction to belong to a certain class. The input value $k$ is the predicted value using the linear function $\\textbf{w}^T\\textbf{x+b}$ that defines the decision boundary. The optimal $\\textbf{w}$ for our linear decision boundary can be found by minimizing the appropriate loss function for logistic regression.\n",

        "  - This algorithm classifies the labels by recursively building a decision tree. The branches are split based on the amount of information gain from each scenario, and our goal is to maximize the information gain from each split. Below is the mathematical expression of the information maximization: $$argmax_B G(S,B) = H(S) - \\sum_{i=1}^t \\frac{|S_i|}{|S|} H(S_i)$$ where $B$ is the configuration that splits the data points, $S$ is the data points setting of current split, each $S_i$ belongs to the data points setting of a branch $i$, and $H(S)$ determines the uncertainty/information of $S$. We will be using sklearn for this algorithm.\n",

ROC is a probability curve and AUC represents the degree or measure of separability.\n",
